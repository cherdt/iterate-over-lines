Iterate over lines in a file
============================

These are examples of iterating over the lines of a file and processing each line in Linux. One example uses Bash script, the other 2 user Perl.

These files accompany the blog post at [http://osric.com/chris/accidental-developer/2016/09/ways-to-iterate-over-lines-of-a-file-in-linux/]

Notes
-----
I use _echo_ generically to represent some other command or script external to the script.
